        <title>Pub Productivity and the Surface Pro</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted a device for working from the Pub. As a small-business owner, I’m always working: at home, at lunch, at happy-hour. I wanted a device more portable than my workhorse laptop so that I could effortlessly bring it with me, but more functional than my mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not a tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tablets are still, mostly, about consumption. You watch, read, play, and listen on a tablet. Sometimes you edit on a tablet, but few create, few can “work”, and that’s what I need to do. This is my search for the Pub Productivity computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;apple-ipad-pro&quot;&gt;Apple iPad Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main computer is a 2016 15” Macbook Pro from before the touchbar garbage. I love it, so it was obvious to start with what Apple sees as the solution for the mobile worker: the iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardware on the iPad Pro is amazing. It’s light. It’s fast. It’s responsive. It’s almost perfect, except for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/posts/pub-productivity-and-the-surface-pro/ipad-pro-cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;Uneven keyboard cover on the iPad Pro&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, doesn’t that drive you crazy? Why Apple, why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software, on the other hand, is definitely not “Pro”. IOS is still designed around consumption with minor editing capabilities creeping in here and there. I wasn’t going to be able to build slides, fix code, or conduct serious business interactions on it. It’s not what I needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;google-pixelbook&quot;&gt;Google Pixelbook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other device in my life today is a Google Pixel XL, which I also love, so I looked to Google next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pixelbook hardware was as good as the iPad, if not better, which is particularly impressive for how young the device line is. The screen was bright and vibrant, keyboard responsive, and it had an excellent touchpad, which I had missed sorely while using the iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I can’t complain about anything with the Pixelbook hardware. It &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem, again, was the software. ChromeOS was more functional for me than IOS, but there were still whole classes of work that I wouldn’t be able to do. Even with the promise of an integrated Android apps, it only foreshadowed more consumer-first capabilities that I just didn’t need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;microsoft-surface-pro&quot;&gt;Microsoft Surface Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begrudgingly, I considered the Surface Pro. Microsoft has released some really interesting devices in the past few years, but I still have this (not entirely undeserved) bad taste in my mouth over their products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardware of the Surface Pro is very nice. It’s a little bit thicker than I want it to be, and a little bit heavier–but it’s also more powerful. The screen is beautiful, keyboard is responsive, and the touchpad is getting better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is my theme here, the software is really the trouble. The Surface Pro runs Windows 10, which is highly functional and capable of doing everything I could imagine needing to do. But the Surface Pro needs every ounce of its hefty hardware to drive the incredibly heavy Windows 10 OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “entry level” Surface Pro, with a Core M processor, is woefully unusable–incapable of driving the OS alone jank-free. Don’t bother with anything less than the Core i5. Even then, the device shudders occasionally while resuming, switching apps, or rotating the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect to spend the first 24 hours installing the updates for Windows, reversing the “helpful” setting defaults, and removing their pre-installed bloatware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Candy Crush? Really Microsoft?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can get past that–and I know, it’s a big if–it is really amazing what I can do with this smallish device. Powering through emails and work tasks in Firefox, updating and editing slides in Powerpoint, or fixing bits of software with Visual Studio Code, it all worked well-enough for me to be productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s what I bought, and what I’m writing this article on now: my Surface Pro 2017 i5. I now have an Apple laptop, a Google phone, and a Microsoft tablet. Screw vendor lock in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s definitely not going to replace my Macbook Pro as the daily workhorse, but it’s portable enough and functional enough to get the job done when down at the pub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Apple Power Adapter Hack</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just purchased a new 2015 Macbook Pro, which is fantastic. The first brand of computer that I’ve ever purchased more than once. But they have a major flaw: the Power Adapter cords. Maybe I’m just too rough with them, but they tear and fray on me around the ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These cables aren’t cheap, so one of the first things I did after unboxing was to reinforce the cables. It’s a quick hack that you can do with a few extra clicky-pens you have laying about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/posts/apple-power-adapter-hack/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spring wrapped on Apple Power Cable&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, get the springs out of two clicky-pens for the two ends of the power cable. Also remember to disconnect the cable from power so you don’t get an accidental shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/posts/apple-power-adapter-hack/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spring wrapped on Apple Power Cable&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take one spring and push a gap about halfway into the spring onto the cable next to one end, below the neck. Note the turn of the spring and carefully wind with the turn down the length of the cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/posts/apple-power-adapter-hack/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spring wrapped on Apple Power Cable&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get to the end of the spring, you may need a pliers to get the last bit wrapped. Be sure to get the end gripping tight, it may dig a bit into the plastic, which will hold it in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/posts/apple-power-adapter-hack/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spring wrapped on end of cable&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the unwound end of the spring and wind it over the neck. If you can get at least one turn of the spring over the neck, you can “screw” the spring on fully. Try to get the spring as close to the end as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/posts/apple-power-adapter-hack/6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spring wrapped on end of cable&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repeat for the other side, and enjoy an better tensioned cable with fewer tears.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Combine Gmail and Google Apps Inboxes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently setup a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/work/apps/business/&quot;&gt;Google Apps&lt;/a&gt; account for &lt;a href=&quot;http://trackjs.com&quot;&gt;TrackJS&lt;/a&gt;. Right away I missed having all my email in one place–don’t make me have two tabs open Google!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some quick searching, it looks like there are a few ways to make this happen. Most of the Internet thinks I should setup a POP account. But then I need to wait for the polling period, and that’s not fast enough for my obsessive-compulsive emailing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I setup forwarding. From you Google Apps account, setup Account Forwarding to your personal account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/posts/combine-gmail-google-apps-inbox/combine-gmail-google-apps-inbox-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google Apps Setup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll have to confirm it with an emailed link to your personal account, but that easily solves the first part of the problem. Now you need to respond. From your Gmail account, setup a an account to “Send Mail As” and add your information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/posts/combine-gmail-google-apps-inbox/combine-gmail-google-apps-inbox-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gmail Setup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure to check “Reply from the same address the message was sent to”, so you don’t get some confused customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it! The magic of Google mail makes everything else work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Getting Done</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a hundred things I should be doing right now. &lt;a href=&quot;http://trackjs.com&quot;&gt;My company&lt;/a&gt; is adding customers faster than I can count. My clients have work they need me to finish. I should be making sure my data backups work, or migrating my &lt;a href=&quot;http://fastmail.com&quot;&gt;email away from Google&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I know, I’ll start a blog.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could share all these interesting things I’m working on. Surely people care about that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I should talk about is &lt;strong&gt;breaking through software perfectionism and shipping!&lt;/strong&gt; Clearly, there is no irony in delaying my other projects to start a blog about getting software done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where do I begin?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds of things to do: automate deployment, tailor UI, brand graphics, content schedules, commenting systems… this will take me days to build!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all my projects, I &lt;del&gt;wanted&lt;/del&gt; needed the perfect system. It had to be as valuable as &lt;a href=&quot;http://hanselman.com&quot;&gt;Hanselman&lt;/a&gt; and as polished as &lt;a href=&quot;http://37signals.com/svn&quot;&gt;Signal vs Noise&lt;/a&gt;. It had to represent my experience as a developer and reflect my own values. Because &lt;em&gt;“if something is worth doing, it’s worth doing right”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That idea has destroyed more projects than I care to recall. I’ve never built even one system “right”, how could I do it for everything?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; need to do here? This blog isn’t the important project, it is a gateway to the important projects. It needs to get done. I need to ship and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is Minimum Viable Product (MVP) here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grab a domain&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-ghost-application&quot;&gt;Install a blog platform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what I really need to do. Get it done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software isn’t done. It’s never done, but it can be good enough. This blog is good enough, for now. Now I’m moving forward to shipping things that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
