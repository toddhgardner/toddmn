        <h2>JavaScript Outlaws</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript errors are running rampant in the web. It is the most hostile development environment
          imaginable. The landrush of complex frameworks, expanding browser capability, and unreliable networks have
          made for an unpredictable environment rife with problems. Errors are common, and we need to run them down and
          bring them to justice.

          This error has been obfuscated by the browser's Same-Origin Policy. It could be an error
          from third-party services, advertising networks, social widgets, or anything hosted outside of your domain.
          Browsers will hide the error details from these scripts to prevent potentially sensitive information from
          leaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Capture this browser behavior error by decorating scripts loaded from external domains with a
          <code>crossorigin</code> attribute.
