        <p>
          JavaScript errors are running rampant in the web. It is the most hostile development environment
          imaginable. The landrush of complex frameworks, expanding browser capability, and unreliable networks have
          made for an unpredictable environment rife with problems. Errors are common, and we need to run them down and
          bring them to justice.

          This error has been obfuscated by the browser's Same-Origin Policy. It could be an error
          from third-party services, advertising networks, social widgets, or anything hosted outside of your domain.
          Browsers will hide the error details from these scripts to prevent potentially sensitive information from
          leaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Capture this browser behavior error by decorating scripts loaded from external domains with a
          <code>crossorigin</code> attribute.

        <p>
          Third-Party scripts that run on your page, such as advertisers and services, change their scripts
          outside of your control. This can cause unexpected behavior and bugs at inconvenient times.
        </p>
        <p>
          When possible, host third-party scripts from your own servers or CDNs to prevent unplanned changes.
          Some third-parties, such as <a href="https://trackjs.com/">TrackJS</a>, will make versioned endpoints available.

          Individual resources on a page can fail to load in the real world due to flaky networks and unpredictable

        <p>
          Always safety-check for the existance of APIs loaded separately. Before you call jQuery, make sure jQuery

        <h2>Memory Leaks</h2>
        <p>
          Complex web applications that render dynamic elements have a high risk of leaking browser memory. Developers
          need to take care to avoid references to dynamic elements, such as binding events.
        </p>
        <p>
          Memory audit capabilities have advanced significantly in browsers. You should explore your application periodically
          for "steps" in memory utilization.
